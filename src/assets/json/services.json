    "longDescription": "Ever wondered why your business is not getting organic leads in spite of having a good online presence with the perfect website for your business? Your website may be lacking proper SEO.\n\nSearch engine optimization (SEO) is the process of improving your website's visibility in search engines like Google and Bing. This happens by increasing the relevance of your content to specific keywords, as well as by improving other factors like site load speed and freshness of content. Your rankings in search engines also depend on your backlinks - the links you have from other websites - and the quality of these backlinks matter as well. A poor-quality link from an unrelated or spammy website will do more harm than good to your rankings in search engines, so take care when building your link portfolio.\n\nAt Softobotics, we will help your website rank high on search engines so that your business can get the best organic leads it deserves. Using tools like AHREFS and Semrush, our SEO Experts will guide your business towards an epitome of online growth.",
