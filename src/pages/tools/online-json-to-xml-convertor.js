          <h2>What is JSON?</h2>
          <p>
            JSON is an open standard file format and data interchange format
            that uses human-readable text to store and transmit data objects
            consisting of attributeâ€“value pairs and arrays.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is a common data format with diverse uses in electronic data
            interchange, including that of web applications with servers.
          </p>
          <p>
            JSON format syntax has been derived from Javascript, but it is a
            language independent.
          </p>
          <p>
            JSON structure consist of object or array of objects , Objects are
            key-value pairs enclosed in inverted commas. Arrays are also data
            sets containing key-value pairs enclosed in square brackets. The
            whole code is enclosed in curly brackets.
          </p>
          <p>
            JSON structure is as simple Javascript object structure, So it's
            very easy to understand.
          </p>
          <h2>What is XML?</h2>
          <p>
            XML stands for Extensible Markup Language is a markup language like
            HTML, it was originated from SGML for web use. It is used to
            represent structured text as well as to transfer data across the
            internet.
          </p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;XML is an extensible language, so you can use it to create
            your own tags and rules of markup languages like HTML.
          </p>
          <p>
            The XML structure is very easy to use who have little bit knowledge
            of HTML and XML file should have the root element.
          </p>
          <p>
            The defined tags used inside the root element contain attributes
            that are objects (key-value pairs).
          </p>
          <p>
            The whole XML is structured to obtain a hierarchal or tree
            structure.
          </p>
