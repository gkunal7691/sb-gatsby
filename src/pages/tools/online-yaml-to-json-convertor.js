          <p>
            JSON is an open standard file format and data interchange format
            that uses human-readable text to store and transmit data objects
            consisting of attributeâ€“value pairs and arrays.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is a common data format with diverse uses in electronic data
            interchange, including that of web applications with servers.
          </p>
          <p>
            JSON format syntax has been derived from Javascript, but it is a
            language independent.
          </p>
          <p>
            JSON structure consist of object or array of objects , Objects are
            key-value pairs enclosed in inverted commas. Arrays are also data
            sets containing key-value pairs enclosed in square brackets. The
            whole code is enclosed in curly brackets.
          </p>
          <p>
            JSON structure is as simple Javascript object structure, So it's
            very easy to understand.
          </p>

            stored or transmitted.
          </p>
          <p>The YAML structure is very easy to use.</p>
          <p>
            The whole YAML is structured to obtain a hierarchal or tree
            structure.
